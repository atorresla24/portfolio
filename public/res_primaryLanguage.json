      "description": "Before I decided to change careers I was a sophomore student attending Stony Brook University in New York majoring in astrophysics. I also worked part-time at a Lowes. I decided to learn software development because coding has always been something that has piqued my interest but I have been and still am fascinated with the science of the universe. I chose this specific skill because my aunt is a back end coder and I have always preferred working with a team out of reach of public interaction so I decided that learning coding and becoming a back end software developer wouldn't be such a bad career. I would prefer to be a back end coder simply because it interests me and also because I would like to strive for a position that works more with behind-the-scenes work. My prior experience at Code Fellows makes me feel more than confident in my new career in tech and I am more than proud in my capabilities. Even so, I will still continue to improve in anyway I can and am open to any suggestions or opinions. I am not fond of limiting myself by feeling I have reached a level of comfortability. To improve every day and be better than I was the day prior is the goal. ",
